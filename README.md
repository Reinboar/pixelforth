# Pixel Forth
Pixel Forth is a FORTH-variant cross-compiler primarily targetting the original GameBoy. A port of Pixel Forth currently exists for the original Playstation but it is still very immature compared to the main compiler and is not yet publicly available.

## Features
The flavor of FORTH that this cross-compiler supports has the following features:
- Quotations and quotation based conditional words
- Array objects and literals
- Ability to include binary files
- Ability to embed compile-time Ruby and runtime GBZ80 code
- Comments via `(`, `)`, and `\`
- Recursion
- Named constants and variables
- Inline words
- Coroutines
- Locals

## Caveats
Due to the nature of FORTH cross-compilers, it's not practically feasible to write
compile-time semantics in FORTH. Because of this, words defined in Ruby have a 
key named `compile` that contain a lambda that is executed at compile-time when
the word is encountered in a source file.

## Planned features
- Bootstrapped runtime pixelforth interpreter
- Support for serial communication via the link port
- More example programs
- Thorough documentation for newer features
- Separate code for compiler implementation and primitives to ease porting efforts

## Prerequisites
- RGBDS (I've only tested with 6.1, older versions probably work as well)
- Ruby (version 2.7+)

## Using the compiler
`./make.sh <source file>`
This will compile `<source file>` and generate the following:
- An assembly source file (.asm)
- A symbol list file (.sym)
- An object file (.o)
- And the header-fixed ROM file (.gb)

The recommended emulator to use while debugging programs written in Pixel Forth
is [SameBoy](https://sameboy.github.io/) since it will automatically detect and load
the symbol table generated by RGBDS, along with decent debugging features in general. BGB is also a good alternative with equivalent symbol table support.
